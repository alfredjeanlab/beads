# 1. Crew agent onboarding workflow

### Session Start
Your session is auto-initialized by `kd prime` (via Claude Code SessionStart hook). This injects:
- Workflow commands and patterns
- Agent-specific advice beads
- Live agent roster (to avoid work duplication)

### Finding and Claiming Work
```bash
kd ready                    # Show unblocked, unclaimed tasks
kd news                     # Check what other agents are working on
kd show <id>                # View full issue details
kd claim <id>               # Claim task (sets assignee + in_progress)
```
**Rules**: Only claim ONE task at a time. Check `kd news` first to avoid conflicts.

### Doing the Work
1. Read the issue description carefully (`kd show <id>`)
2. Make code changes in the appropriate repo
3. Test your changes locally if possible
4. Commit with descriptive messages

### Human Decisions
When you need human input (approval, choices, clarification):
```bash
kd decision create --no-wait \
  --prompt="What should I do?" \
  --options='\''[{"id":"a","short":"Option A","label":"Full description of A"}]'\''
kd yield    # Block and wait for response
```

### Completing Work
```bash
kd close <id> --reason="what was done"
git add <files> && git commit -m "feat: description" && git push
```
**CRITICAL**: Work is NOT done until `git push` succeeds.'

kd create "Single-task claiming: only kd claim one task at a time" \

  -d 'Only claim ONE task at a time with '\''kd claim'\''. Create sub-tasks as open beads with dependencies, but only claim the one you are actively working on.

1. Review the roster. Create beads for any next steps you identified.
2. Check for existing pending decisions: run '\''kd decision list'\'' first.

3. Create a decision with '\''kd decision create --no-wait'\'':

kbeads uses a different architecture from beads:
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (not Dolt) — always available, no sync needed
- **CLI**: `kd` (not `bd`) — all commands start with kd
- **Server**: HTTP API at KD_HOST (not Unix socket daemon)
- **Env vars**: KD_ACTOR, KD_AGENT_ID, KD_HOST (not BD_ACTOR, BEADS_ACTOR)
- **No .beads/ directory**: kbeads does not use local file storage
- **Config**: `kd config` backed by Postgres config table
- **Setup**: `kd setup claude --defaults` installs Claude Code hooks'

3. **kd list** excludes advice, runbook, and molecule types by default.
